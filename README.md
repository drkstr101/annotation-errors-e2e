# Stackbit MUI Next.js Starter

A simple starting point for a Stackbit project that includes support for [MUI](https://mui.com/).

## Features

This is meant to be a simple starting point that demonstrates the use of bringing your own component library, such as MUI.

In addition to MUI support, this project contains the following:

- **Flexible Pages:** Simple and flexible page model that lets editors add new pages.
- **Basic Components:** A few basic components to add to new pages.
- **Layout Elements:** Header and footer elements automatically added to pages.
- **Component & Template Presets:** Predefined arrangements of content and components for faster editing. [Learn more](https://docs.stackbit.com/conceptual-guides/content-presets/).
- **TypeScript Support:** Components and content are type-safe. (See `types` directory for definitions.)

## Quickstart

To get started after cloning this repository, first install dependencies:

    npm install

Then you can run the Next.js development server:

    npm run dev

### Stackbit Local Development

If you'd also like to run Stackbit Dev locally, first ensure the Stackbit CLI.

    npm install -g @stackbit/cli

Then start Stackbit's development server in another terminal window/tab:

    stackbit dev

This will provide an `app.stackbit.com...` URL to open and work with Stackbit locally.
